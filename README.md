# This is the Storm Ideas Candidate Technical Test

# Introduction

The test is designed to allow you to show us your knowledge and experience within a plausible web application scenerio.

To get started either download the current latest master release (.zip) or fork the repository and work from there - the choice is yours.

Once you have a local copy of the code, open it in Visual Studio, restore the NuGet packages, re-build the solution and run the web project, if all is well you will see the introduction and a list of tasks to consider.

You can choose whether to complete the tasks sequentially or out of sequence, or whether you complete all the available tasks.  Some tasks are designed to test more experienced developers, so we will not be expecting all candidates to have completed all the tasks.

*Task 999* as the name implies is very much optional and if you choose to give this a go we will likely be very impressed, but it is not something we are expecting. We might, however, discuss your thoughts on how you would implement this during any interview.

# Code Comments

Feel free to comment your code to describe your thought processes when during with each task - this will help create discussion points during an interview.
